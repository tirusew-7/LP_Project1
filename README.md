 Data-Related Issues:
 
1. Inconsistent Column Names:
 
Data18's column names differ from other datasets, causing incongruity.
Solution: Rename Data18's column names to align with other datasets.
 
2. Unnecessary Column:
 
Data20 includes an unnecessary 'unnamed: 9' column.
Solution: Remove the 'unnamed: 9' column from Data20.
 
3. Missing Columns in Data18:
 
Data18 lacks columns for founders, investors, and the year founded.
Solution: Add missing columns with null values for founders, investors, and the year founded in Data18.
 
4. 'Amount' Column Format:
 
The 'amount' column in all datasets contains currency symbols, commas, and is stored as a string.
Solution: Convert 'amount' values in all datasets to dollars as floating-point numbers.
 
5. Null Values:
 
Null values are present in the 'founded', 'headquarter', 'sector', and 'stage' columns.
Solution: Replace null values in the 'amount' column using the mean or median.
 
6. 'Headquarter' Column Variations:
 
Data18's 'headquarter' column contains additional information compared to other datasets.
Solution: Modify Data18's 'headquarter' by separating values with commas and keeping only the first word.
 
7. Inconsistent 'Sector' Values:
 
'Sector' values vary among all datasets, making standardization necessary.
Solution: Standardize sector values by merging similar categories (e.g., 'ecommerce' and 'e-commerce platforms' into 'e-commerce').
 
8. Data Type Inconsistencies:
 
Most data types are represented as objects, lacking uniformity.
Solution: Adjust the data types of each column accordingly for consistency and accuracy.
